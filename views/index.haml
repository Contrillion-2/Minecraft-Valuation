  %h2 How is this calculated?
  %p 
    Notch, and his company Mojang, have been very public about the amount of sales Minecraft has made (Revenue).  Using public data around the web, we can do a rough calculation for his costs (including SG&A).  Subtract the two and one has EBITDA.  Finally one applies a multiplier that is based upon Price to EBITDA ratio of other comparable companies.  Simple right?
  %h2 Breaking it down
  %h3 Revenue -- €#{@top_line}
  %p 
    The Minecraft site has a great 
    %a(href="http://www.minecraft.net/stats.jsp") stats page
    where one can see just how many copies of Minecraft have been sold in the past 24 hours. Now each copy sells for €15, but Paypal takes €.45 of that.  So really, Mojang makes €14.55 per copy sold.
  %p
    So the math here is ( #{@players} copies sold in the past 24 hours ) * ( 14.55 per copy ) * (365 Days in a year)
  %h3 SG&A
  %p
    Here comes the tricky part, finding out the costs of developing and maintaining Minecraft.  Now none of this information is posted by Notch, but a little digging around and we can come up with some estimates. Here is how its broken down, and how to find supporting data.
  %h4 Rent -- €#{@rent_cost} 
  %p
    The average rent in Stockholm Sweden is €#{@rent} per sq foot per year[
    %a(href="http://bcg.thetimes.co.uk/Europe/Sweden/Stockholm#Business_costs")1
    ].  A good medium sized office for six people is #{@office_space} sq ft.  
  %p
    So the math is (€#{@rent} per sq ft per year) * (#{@office_space} sq ft)
  %h4 Salaries -- €#{@salary_cost}
  %p
    A great salary for Stockholm is €#{@salary}[
    %a(href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/stockholm-salary-SRCH_IL.0,9_IM1136_SDAS.htm") 2
    ]. Notch has also stated that he's looking to hire up to five more people for his company[
    %a(href="http://notch.tumblr.com/post/1075326804/hiring-some-people-getting-an-office-and-all-that") 3
    ].
  %p
    So if he pays them (and himself) top salaries, the math is (€#{@salary} per employee) * (#{@employees} employees)
  %h4 Servers / Bandwidth -- €#{@networking}
  %p
    This one was pretty hard, so lets over estimate.  We figured every player of Minecraft downloaded 10MB of data every time they play.  Again grabbing from the 
    %a(href="http://www.minecraft.net/stats.jsp") stats page
    , we add both the survival and creative players, multiplied by 10MB and then multiplied by 30 to get the monthly data usage.  This added up to be 15 TB.  Then using 
    %a(href="http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/calc5.html") Amazon's S3 price calculator
    , we punch in 15 TB of storage, 15 TB of download, and 15 TB of upload to the service.  It then punched out the cost.
  %p
    So the math is (Number of total players in one day) * (10 MB) * (30 Days) = (Total Monthly data usage)
  %p
    And then using Amazon's S3 price calculator (15 TB storage) AND (Total Monthly Usage Download) AND (Total Monthly Usage Upload) * (12 months in a year)
  %h4 Legal -- €#{@legal_cost}
  %p
    The two main legal fees Minecraft face are Professional Fees, and Payroll tax.  One would figure lawyers are as greedy in Sweden as much as they are in America, so Professional Fees are €#{@legal} (over estimate).  Total Payroll Tax in Sweden is around 40%[
    %a(href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll_tax#Sweden") 4
    ] meaning, if one is paying one's employees €100, one needs to be paying €40 to taxes.
  %p
    So the math is (#{@salary_cost} total spending on salaries) * (7/5) + #{@legal}
  %h4 Office Supplies -- €#{@supplies}
  %p
    Just to make sure we aren't underestimating, lets say that Notch spends a ridicules amount on buy his employees the most amazing staplers and pens.
  %h4 Miscellaneous Things (aka. too lazy to find out) -- €#{@misc_sga}
  %p
    Finally we have a catchall miscellaneous cost, which is meant to cover anything major cost we may have missed, to make sure we get an underestimated valuation.
  %h4 Total Yearly SG&A -- €#{@sga}
  %h3 Multiplier
  %p
    Now that we have the revenue and SG&A we can find the EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization).  In this case the EBITDA is €#{@top_line - @sga} (Revenue - SG&A).  Multipliers are a tricky business. Usually based off of similar public company's Price to EBITDA ratios. The multiplier accounts for future growth and future earnings.  Though Mojang has an insane profit margin (#{@top_line - @sga} / #{@top_line}), it is not an annuity based business. Mojang is also a very new company and it is unknown whether the level of growth Minecraft is showing can be sustained.  So again we underestimate and give Mojang a #{@multi}X multiplier.  This is very low for a company, but it will improve with time.  If Mojang can produce another popular and high grossing title, its legitimacy will be proven and its multiplier can one day reach something around 20X like Electronic Arts (in 2005 pre recession)[
    %a(href="http://nresearch.fr/reports/433.pdf") 5
    ].
  %p
    So the math for total value is (#{@top_line - @sga} EBITDA * #{@multi}X multiplier)
